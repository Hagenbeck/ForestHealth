# Forest Health Classification

This machine learning project classifies forest health using Copernicus Sentinel satellite data (2023-2025). The model analyzes multi-spectral satellite imagery to detect and classify forest conditions.

## Repository Contents
- Model training and evaluation code
- Data preprocessing utilities from Sentinel Hub API
- Visualization and analysis scripts
- Documentation and methodology

## Environment Setup

1. **Create poetry environment:**
```bash
  poetry install
  poetry env activate
```

2. **Copy the template:**
```bash
  cp template.env .env
```
3. **Add your credentials to .env:**  
If you want to download data from sentinelhub. 
```
SENTINELHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-actual-client-id
SENTINELHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-actual-secret
```

## Data
Due to Copernicus API rate limits (1 year per month per account), the multi-year dataset is not included in this repository. Visit the live demo above to see the classification results and model performance.

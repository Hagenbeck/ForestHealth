    "##### The Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Height**: represents the elevation above sea level in meters. The study area spans roughly 500-1100m, with higher values concentrated in the northwestern region around the Hornisgrinde and valley structures clearly visible going longitudinal.\n",
    "* **Slope Angle**: The angle of the slope of the pixels in degree. Over the study area the slope angles are mostly structured in similar ways between 0° and 20° with some spots near valleys reaching even >35°. The tops of mountain ranges tend to be more flat than the rest of the AOI.\n",
    "* **Aspect Angle**: The angle of the aspect (direction) in degree. Clearly visualizes the mountain ranges and valleys showing which areas have which sunlight exposure, with mostly either south or north orientated mountain faces.\n",
    "* **Northness**: Indicates how northern the aspect of that pixel is, representing a component of the aspect. High values represent a northern orientation and with low sunlight exposure. Low values indicate a southern orientation and thus high sunlight exposure during the mid of a day. The values are really high on either end of the spectrum across the whole study area, which reinforces the impression that the mountain ranges mostly run east-west.\n",
    "* **Eastness**: Indicates how eastern the aspect of that pixel is, representing a component of the aspect. High values indicate an eastern orientation, with sunlight in the morning, low values represent a western orientation and with that high sunlight exposure during the afternoon and evening. In contrast to the Northness, it is visible that mostly in the western part around the Hornisgrinde, there are large areas with high and low eastness values, while in the rest of the AOI the values are much more often closer to zero and areas with high values are much smaller.\n",
    "* **Topographic Position Index (TPI)**: Indicates how high a pixel is in relation to its neighbours. In this case all the pixel in a 250 meter radius are considered neighbours. This feature follows closely the valleys and ridges represented through the height measure.\n",
    "* **Topographic Wetness Index (TWI)**: Indicates how much humidity is available at a pixel, using the steepness and water accumulation in that area. This visualization shows wide areas with high values in the valleys with smaller streams splitting up, the higher they go up a ridge all across the AOI.\n",
    "* **Upstream Contributing Area (UCA) (untransformed & log10)**: Shows how much area is dispersing its water through that pixel, to get a feel for where creeks and streams might be. Shows forking streams, just like the TWI but with more clear streams rather than wide bands flowing through the valleys. The log transformed UCA is visualizing the values much better as the extremely high values get reduced so that the range of the colorbar is not getting as stretched.\n",
    "* **Distance to the next Stream**: Euclidean distance to the next \"stream\", which are pixels having a UCA above 300,000m². This shows kind of a inversion of the UCA-Map with high values being at ridge tops and low values being all around the streams in the area.\n",
    "* **Cluster Label**: The label of the clustering for the pixels. Here it is clearly visible that the majority of degraded forest patches are in the southern middle of the AOI."

    "As the logistic regression is only around 0.7% better than a model, that just predicts the overall class_probability, there is another indication that topography is not the major driver for forest degradation.  \n",
    "However it still is interesting that this model considers eastness as the best feature to distinguish degraded from healthy, which could be due to the sun exposure during the afternoon and thus the hottest hours of a day. Log_UCA being negatively correlated is also quite reasonable, as areas with less water intuitively have a higher chance of degradation. Interestingly, TWI shows a positive coefficient, meaning higher soil moisture is associated with increased degradation probability, contrary to what log_UCA suggests. This contradiction may reflect interactions between correlated water-related features.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This analysis investigated whether topographic features are associated with the forest degradation patterns identified through clustering. The results consistently indicate a weak but measurable relationship: northness and eastness show the strongest associations (ε² = 0.051 and 0.006 respectively), while the ordinal logistic regression explains only ~0.7% of variance beyond a null model (McFadden R² = 0.007).\n",
    "The spatial concentration of degradation around specific ridges and a particular elevation band (~920m) suggests that geographic position matters more than topography alone. The dominant drivers of degradation likely lie elsewhere, which is a question explored further in the accompanying website post on [here](https://www.peer-schlieker.de/projects/forest-health-analysis)."

The features (NDVI temporal patterns, spatial heterogeneity) naturally capture this gradual variation.\n",

Density-based methods like DBSCAN and OPTICS rely on low-density regions separating clusters—which don't exist here.

    "- **Negative NDWI change**: Water content has declined over the five-year period, showing progressive deterioration\n",
    "- **Low temporal variability (SAVI)**: Dead or severely stressed trees exhibit minimal seasonal variation, unlike healthy vegetation with annual growth cycles\n",
